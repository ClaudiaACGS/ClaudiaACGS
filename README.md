I am a Mobile Engineer driven by the passion of turning ideas into seamless digital experiences. My journey combines native Android (Kotlin & Java) and cross-platform development with Flutter (Dart) and React Native (TypeScript), where I focus on building apps that are not only functional, but also scalable, maintainable, and enjoyable to use. I believe that great software comes from a balance of clean architecture, modular design, and strong principles like SOLID, paired with creativity and empathy for the user. For me, writing code is more than solving problems — it’s about crafting solutions that last, grow, and inspire. Whether I’m implementing state management, practicing TDD, or collaborating through code reviews and Git workflows, my goal is always the same: deliver high-quality mobile apps that make a real impact.
